{"name":"ApexClass","description":"Represents an Apex class.","summary":"In Salesforce, the `{ApexClass}` object represents an Apex class, which is a fundamental building block for custom application logic. Apex is a strongly-typed, object-oriented programming language that allows developers to execute flow and transaction control statements on the Salesforce platform. Apex classes can encapsulate reusable sets of instructions that can be invoked by various parts of the application, such as triggers, web services, or scheduled jobs.\n\nKey characteristics of the `{ApexClass}` object include:\n\n1. **Structure**: An Apex class can contain properties, methods, constructors, and inner classes. The class can be defined with various access modifiers (e.g., public, private) to control its visibility and usage within the application.\n\n2. **Functionality**: Apex classes enable developers to implement business logic, manipulate data, and interact with the Salesforce database. They can be used to create custom web services, handle complex validation rules, and automate processes.\n\n3. **Execution Context**: Apex code runs in a multi-tenant environment, meaning it shares resources with other customers. Salesforce imposes governor limits to ensure efficient use of resources and prevent any single tenant from monopolizing system resources.\n\n4. **Testing and Deployment**: Apex classes must be thoroughly tested using unit tests. Salesforce requires that at least 75% of the code is covered by tests before deployment to production environments. This ensures the reliability and stability of the custom logic.\n\n5. **Metadata**: The `{ApexClass}` object also includes metadata that describes the class, such as its name, status (e.g., active, inactive), and API version. Metadata can be used to manage and deploy classes across different Salesforce environments.\n\nIn summary, the `{ApexClass}` object is a critical component for developing custom logic and functionalities within Salesforce, allowing developers to extend the platformâ€™s capabilities and tailor it to specific business needs.","attributes":[{"name":"Id","type":"id"},{"name":"NamespacePrefix","type":"string"},{"name":"Name","type":"string"},{"name":"ApiVersion","type":"double"},{"name":"Status","type":"picklist"},{"name":"IsValid","type":"boolean"},{"name":"BodyCrc","type":"double"},{"name":"Body","type":"textarea"},{"name":"LengthWithoutComments","type":"int"},{"name":"CreatedDate","type":"datetime"},{"name":"CreatedById","type":"reference"},{"name":"LastModifiedDate","type":"datetime"},{"name":"LastModifiedById","type":"reference"},{"name":"SystemModstamp","type":"datetime"}],"label":"Apex Class","application":"salesforce","attributesString":"[{\"name\":\"Id\",\"type\":\"id\"},{\"name\":\"NamespacePrefix\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"Name\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"ApiVersion\",\"type\":\"double\"},{\"name\":\"Status\",\"type\":\"picklist\"},{\"name\":\"IsValid\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"BodyCrc\",\"type\":\"double\"},{\"name\":\"Body\",\"type\":\"textarea\"},{\"name\":\"LengthWithoutComments\",\"type\":\"int\"},{\"name\":\"CreatedDate\",\"type\":\"datetime\"},{\"name\":\"CreatedById\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"LastModifiedDate\",\"type\":\"datetime\"},{\"name\":\"LastModifiedById\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"SystemModstamp\",\"type\":\"datetime\"}]"}
