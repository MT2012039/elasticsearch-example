{"name":"sc_ic_task_defn_staging","description":"Generic table for tasks that need to be performed, used as a parent table for many other task-based tables like incidents and changes.","summary":"The `sc_ic_task_defn_staging` object in ServiceNow is a table used for staging task definitions within the IT Change Management process. This table is typically utilized to temporarily store or prepare task definitions before they are finalized and moved to the main task definition table. Hereâ€™s a summary of its key aspects:\n\n1. **Purpose**: It serves as a staging area for task definitions, allowing for the preparation, review, and validation of tasks before they are formally added to the change management process.\n\n2. **Fields**: The table likely includes fields such as task name, description, type, status, and any other attributes relevant to defining a task within the change management context.\n\n3. **Usage**: It is commonly used during the planning phase of a change request to define the tasks that need to be performed. Once the tasks are reviewed and approved, they can be moved to the main task definition table.\n\n4. **Integration**: This staging table is often integrated with other change management tables and workflows, ensuring that task definitions are properly managed and tracked throughout the change lifecycle.\n\n5. **Workflow**: Tasks defined in this staging table may go through a series of approvals and reviews before being finalized, ensuring that all necessary steps are accounted for and that the change process is well-documented.\n\nIn summary, the `sc_ic_task_defn_staging` object in ServiceNow is a crucial component for managing and preparing task definitions in the IT Change Management process, ensuring that tasks are thoroughly reviewed and validated before implementation.","attributes":[{"name":"short_description","type":"translated_text"},{"name":"assignment_group","type":"reference"},{"name":"assignment_user","type":"reference"},{"name":"sys_mod_count","type":"integer"},{"name":"description","type":"translated_text"},{"name":"active","type":"boolean"},{"name":"sc_ic_item_staging","type":"reference"},{"name":"assignment_details","type":"string"},{"name":"sys_updated_on","type":"glide_date_time"},{"name":"sc_ic_task_assign_defn_staging","type":"reference"},{"name":"sys_tags","type":"related_tags"},{"name":"sys_class_name","type":"sys_class_name"},{"name":"sys_id","type":"GUID"},{"name":"sys_package","type":"reference"},{"name":"sys_update_name","type":"string"},{"name":"sys_updated_by","type":"string"},{"name":"assignment_type","type":"string"},{"name":"sys_created_on","type":"glide_date_time"},{"name":"sys_name","type":"string"},{"name":"sys_scope","type":"reference"},{"name":"sys_created_by","type":"string"},{"name":"order","type":"integer"},{"name":"sys_policy","type":"string"}],"label":"Task","application":"servicenow","attributesString":"[{\"name\":\"short_description\",\"type\":\"translated_text\"},{\"name\":\"assignment_group\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"assignment_user\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"sys_mod_count\",\"type\":\"integer\"},{\"name\":\"description\",\"type\":\"translated_text\"},{\"name\":\"active\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"sc_ic_item_staging\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"assignment_details\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"sys_updated_on\",\"type\":\"glide_date_time\"},{\"name\":\"sc_ic_task_assign_defn_staging\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"sys_tags\",\"type\":\"related_tags\"},{\"name\":\"sys_class_name\",\"type\":\"sys_class_name\"},{\"name\":\"sys_id\",\"type\":\"GUID\"},{\"name\":\"sys_package\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"sys_update_name\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"sys_updated_by\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"assignment_type\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"sys_created_on\",\"type\":\"glide_date_time\"},{\"name\":\"sys_name\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"sys_scope\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"sys_created_by\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"order\",\"type\":\"integer\"},{\"name\":\"sys_policy\",\"type\":\"string\"}]"}
