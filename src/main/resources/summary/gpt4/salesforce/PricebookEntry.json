{"name":"PricebookEntry","description":"Represents an entry in a price book that lists the price of a product.","summary":"In Salesforce, the `PricebookEntry` object is a critical component involved in the product and pricing structure within the platform. It acts as an intermediary between `Product2` (the product) and `Pricebook2` (the price book) objects. Essentially, it defines the price of a specific product within a particular price book. Here are some key points about the `PricebookEntry` object:\n\n1. **Associations**: \n   - It links a product (`Product2`) to a price book (`Pricebook2`).\n   - Each `PricebookEntry` represents the price of a product within a specific price book.\n\n2. **Fields**:\n   - `Id`: Unique identifier for the PricebookEntry record.\n   - `Product2Id`: Reference to the associated product.\n   - `Pricebook2Id`: Reference to the associated price book.\n   - `UnitPrice`: The standard price of the product for this entry.\n   - `IsActive`: Indicates if the PricebookEntry is active and available for use.\n   - `UseStandardPrice`: Specifies whether the standard price is used instead of a custom price.\n\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Facilitates pricing flexibility by allowing different prices for the same product in different price books.\n   - Supports various business scenarios, such as different pricing for different customer segments or regions.\n   \n4. **Availability**:\n   - Can be used in both standard and custom price books.\n   - Is essential for creating quotes, orders, and opportunities that involve product sales.\n\nUnderstanding the `PricebookEntry` object is fundamental for managing product pricing and sales processes efficiently in Salesforce.","attributes":[{"name":"Id","type":"id"},{"name":"Name","type":"string"},{"name":"Pricebook2Id","type":"reference"},{"name":"Product2Id","type":"reference"},{"name":"UnitPrice","type":"currency"},{"name":"IsActive","type":"boolean"},{"name":"UseStandardPrice","type":"boolean"},{"name":"CreatedDate","type":"datetime"},{"name":"CreatedById","type":"reference"},{"name":"LastModifiedDate","type":"datetime"},{"name":"LastModifiedById","type":"reference"},{"name":"SystemModstamp","type":"datetime"},{"name":"ProductCode","type":"string"},{"name":"IsDeleted","type":"boolean"},{"name":"IsArchived","type":"boolean"}],"label":"Price Book Entry","application":"salesforce","attributesString":"[{\"name\":\"Id\",\"type\":\"id\"},{\"name\":\"Name\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"Pricebook2Id\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"Product2Id\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"UnitPrice\",\"type\":\"currency\"},{\"name\":\"IsActive\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"UseStandardPrice\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"CreatedDate\",\"type\":\"datetime\"},{\"name\":\"CreatedById\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"LastModifiedDate\",\"type\":\"datetime\"},{\"name\":\"LastModifiedById\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"SystemModstamp\",\"type\":\"datetime\"},{\"name\":\"ProductCode\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"IsDeleted\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"IsArchived\",\"type\":\"boolean\"}]"}
