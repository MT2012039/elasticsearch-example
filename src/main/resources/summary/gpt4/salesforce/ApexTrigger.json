{"name":"ApexTrigger","description":"Represents an Apex trigger.","summary":"In Salesforce, an Apex Trigger is a powerful tool used to execute custom actions before or after events on records in Salesforce. Specifically, an Apex Trigger enables you to perform operations such as insertions, updates, deletions, or undeletions on an object. Here are the key points to understand about Apex Triggers in Salesforce:\n\n1. **Event Handling**: Apex Triggers can execute code in response to specific database events, such as `before insert`, `after insert`, `before update`, `after update`, `before delete`, `after delete`, and `after undelete`.\n\n2. **Automation**: They are used to automate processes and ensure data integrity by enforcing business rules at the database level.\n\n3. **Syntax**: Triggers are written in Apex, Salesforce's proprietary programming language, which is similar to Java and C#.\n\n4. **Context Variables**: Triggers provide context variables like `Trigger.new`, `Trigger.old`, `Trigger.newMap`, and `Trigger.oldMap` to access the records that caused the trigger to fire.\n\n5. **Bulk Processing**: Apex Triggers are designed to handle bulk operations. They are capable of processing multiple records at once, ensuring efficient and scalable performance.\n\n6. **Limitations and Best Practices**: There are governor limits in Salesforce that restrict the number of operations a trigger can perform. Best practices include writing bulk-safe code, avoiding SOQL queries inside loops, and using helper classes to keep trigger logic clean and maintainable.\n\n7. **Deployment**: Triggers are part of the metadata and can be deployed across different Salesforce environments using change sets, Salesforce DX, or other deployment tools.\n\nApex Triggers are essential for extending Salesforce's functionality and customizing it to fit specific business needs, ensuring that complex business logic can be executed seamlessly as part of the data management process.","attributes":[{"name":"Id","type":"id"},{"name":"NamespacePrefix","type":"string"},{"name":"Name","type":"string"},{"name":"TableEnumOrId","type":"picklist"},{"name":"UsageBeforeInsert","type":"boolean"},{"name":"UsageAfterInsert","type":"boolean"},{"name":"UsageBeforeUpdate","type":"boolean"},{"name":"UsageAfterUpdate","type":"boolean"},{"name":"UsageBeforeDelete","type":"boolean"},{"name":"UsageAfterDelete","type":"boolean"},{"name":"UsageIsBulk","type":"boolean"},{"name":"UsageAfterUndelete","type":"boolean"},{"name":"ApiVersion","type":"double"},{"name":"Status","type":"picklist"},{"name":"IsValid","type":"boolean"},{"name":"BodyCrc","type":"double"},{"name":"Body","type":"textarea"},{"name":"LengthWithoutComments","type":"int"},{"name":"CreatedDate","type":"datetime"},{"name":"CreatedById","type":"reference"},{"name":"LastModifiedDate","type":"datetime"},{"name":"LastModifiedById","type":"reference"},{"name":"SystemModstamp","type":"datetime"}],"label":"Apex Trigger","application":"salesforce","attributesString":"[{\"name\":\"Id\",\"type\":\"id\"},{\"name\":\"NamespacePrefix\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"Name\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"TableEnumOrId\",\"type\":\"picklist\"},{\"name\":\"UsageBeforeInsert\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"UsageAfterInsert\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"UsageBeforeUpdate\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"UsageAfterUpdate\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"UsageBeforeDelete\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"UsageAfterDelete\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"UsageIsBulk\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"UsageAfterUndelete\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"ApiVersion\",\"type\":\"double\"},{\"name\":\"Status\",\"type\":\"picklist\"},{\"name\":\"IsValid\",\"type\":\"boolean\"},{\"name\":\"BodyCrc\",\"type\":\"double\"},{\"name\":\"Body\",\"type\":\"textarea\"},{\"name\":\"LengthWithoutComments\",\"type\":\"int\"},{\"name\":\"CreatedDate\",\"type\":\"datetime\"},{\"name\":\"CreatedById\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"LastModifiedDate\",\"type\":\"datetime\"},{\"name\":\"LastModifiedById\",\"type\":\"reference\"},{\"name\":\"SystemModstamp\",\"type\":\"datetime\"}]"}
