{"name":"ContentDocumentLink","description":"Represents the link between a Salesforce CRM Content document or Salesforce file and where it's shared.","summary":"In Salesforce, the `ContentDocumentLink` object is used to represent the relationship between a Salesforce CRM record and a Salesforce file. It essentially acts as a link between a file (represented by the `ContentDocument` object) and a specific record in Salesforce, such as an Account, Opportunity, or Custom Object.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Purpose**:\n   - `ContentDocumentLink` is used to associate files with records in Salesforce. This allows users to attach files to specific records, making it easier to manage and access relevant documents.\n\n2. **Relationships**:\n   - Each `ContentDocumentLink` record links a `ContentDocument` (which represents the file) to a specific Salesforce record (e.g., Account, Opportunity).\n   - The `LinkedEntityId` field in `ContentDocumentLink` specifies the Salesforce record to which the file is linked.\n   - The `ContentDocumentId` field in `ContentDocumentLink` specifies the file being linked.\n\n3. **Fields**:\n   - `Id`: Unique identifier for the `ContentDocumentLink` record.\n   - `ContentDocumentId`: ID of the `ContentDocument` (file) being linked.\n   - `LinkedEntityId`: ID of the Salesforce record to which the file is linked.\n   - `ShareType`: Specifies the type of sharing (e.g., 'V' for viewer, 'C' for collaborator).\n   - `Visibility`: Specifies the visibility of the file (e.g., 'AllUsers', 'InternalUsers', 'SharedUsers').\n\n4. **Use Cases**:\n   - Attaching contracts, proposals, or other relevant documents to Accounts or Opportunities.\n   - Sharing files with specific users or groups within Salesforce.\n   - Managing file versions and ensuring that the latest version is accessible from the linked record.\n\n5. **Permissions**:\n   - Users need appropriate permissions to create, view, or modify `ContentDocumentLink` records. This is typically managed through profiles and permission sets.\n\n### Example:\n\nIf you have a file (e.g., a contract) that you want to attach to an Account record in Salesforce, you would:\n1.
